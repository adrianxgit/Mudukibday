  <!-- 🎉 Title -->
  <h1>Happy Birthday, Mudukki! 💙</h1>

  <!-- 💌 Message -->
  <p>
    18 years of life, and every moment you’ve lived so far has made you into the strong, beautiful person you are today.
    <br><br>
    I know I’ve given you reasons to be hurt, to cry, and to doubt things. But even through all that, you stayed — and that means more to me than words can ever explain.
    <br><br>
    You’ve always had a way of understanding me, even when I couldn’t understand myself. When you speak, when you open up, when you just be <i>you</i> — I never get bored, not even for a second.
    <br><br>
    I’m really lucky to have you in my life. Not everyone gets to meet someone like you — someone who cares deeply, loves fearlessly, and forgives with a heart that’s too big for this world.
    <br><br>
    This is your year. Your adult life is just beginning. Don’t carry old pain with you — not from me, not from anyone.
    <br><br>
    Move forward with hope, with strength, and with that fire in your heart. You deserve only the best things, and I truly believe you'll achieve them — because I know how determined you are.
    <br><br>
    Even if I couldn't support you in every way, I’ll always be here — as your Best friend.
    <br><br>
    So once again, Happy Birthday, Nabeeha. Keep shining, keep growing, and never forget your worth.
    <br><br>
    <b>Insha'Allah, all the good things in life find their way to you. 🌸</b>
  </p>
